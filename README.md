# Nathaniel-Stewart-Portfolio
## About
My name is Nate! I have been making my way towards a career in data analytics with my bachelors degree in Management Information Systems from Georgia College & State University.

While working on my studies, I have acquired the skills and knowledge in working with complex data. It first started out in a database management class that I was attending where I had developed SQL queries in finding information within different systems. 
Ever since then, I have gathered an arsenal of tools and languages such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc. And have used such tools to form a solid foundation of techniques in data analysis such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistics, and machine learning.

And now with the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained, I am always looking for new methods and ideas to improve my skills further.

I hope my portfolio will gather an interest in mind. Thank you and I look forward to hear from you soon.
