# Nathaniel-Stewart-Portfolio
## About
My name is Nate! I have been making my way towards a career in data analytics with my bachelors degree in Management Information Systems from Georgia College & State University.

While working on my studies, I have acquired the skills and knowledge in working with complex data. It first started out in a database management class that I was attending where I had developed SQL queries in finding information within different systems. 
Ever since then, I have gathered an arsenal of tools and languages such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Excel, etc. And have used such tools to form a solid foundation of techniques in data analysis such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistics, and machine learning.

And now with the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained, I am always looking for new methods and ideas to improve my skills further.

I hope my portfolio will gather an interest in mind. Thank you and I look forward to hear from you soon.

## Portfolio Projects

### Mall Customer Segmentation & Clustering
**Code:** [`customer_seg_and_cluster.ipynb`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/customer_seg_and_cluster.ipynb)

**Objective:** To create subsets of a mall target market based on behavioral criteria to gain clarity on the target for marketing activities.

**Description:** This dataset contains a list of customers. The records include factors such as the customer's gender, age, income, and spending score. All of which are being used to develop marketing stratigies. Thus, the dataset is used to identify the most important shopping groups using factors within such.

**Skills:** Machine Learning (K-Means), Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn

### Superstore Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`NJS_sales_analysis_project.ipynb`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/NJS_sales_analysis_project.ipynb)

**Objective:** To analyze the sales history of a superstore and find insights on stores worldwide.

**Description:** This project is focused on finding insights for orders from a successful worldwide superstore.

**Skills:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Data Cleaning

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### Cricket Match Analysis
**Code:** [`Cricket_Match - Data_cleaning - Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Cricket_Match%20-%20Data_cleaning%20-%20Exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb)

**Objective:** To study player highlights from previous cricket matches in recorded history.

**Description:** This project involves simple data cleaning for a cricket match dataset that contains player information including their name, career span, how many matches they have played, batting averages, etc. After data cleaning, exploratory data analysis is performed to calculate certain factors such as a player's career span in years, average batting strike rate, average runs scored by country, etc.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Technology:** Python, Pandas

### WGU - Data Cleaning D206
**Code:** [`D206_Data_Cleaning_Performance_Assessment_NStewart-Copy2.ipynb`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/D206_Data_Cleaning_Performance_Assessment_NStewart-Copy2.ipynb)

**Objective:** To perform successful data cleaning in order to deliver accurate results in finding principal componants within datasets.

**Description:** This project involves performing more advanced data cleaning methods (Plot nullity matrix, finding and removing outliers, using k-Nearest Neighbors Imputation) within healthcare data which would generally contain high amounts of information. In addition, Principal Componant Analysis is performed to determine which variables carry the most emphasis within the dataset. Thus, finding different ways for better decision making and answering research questions.

**Skills:** Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Machine Learning

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Missingno

### COVID Practice Project
**Code:** [`COVID_Practice_Portfolio_Project.sql`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/COVID_Practice_Portfolio_Project.sql)

**Description:** This dataset includes information of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations by country between 2020 and 2021.

**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server

### Nashville Data Cleaning
**Code:** [`Nashville_Housing_Data_2.sql`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Nashville_Housing_Data_2.sql)

**Description:** This project involves data cleaning and manipulation within a dataset that contains a list of houses in Nashville that have been sold between 2013 and 2019.

**Skills:** Data Query Language (DQL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), Data Definition Language (DDL)

**Technology:** Microsoft SQL Server

### HR Analysis
**Code:** [`HR_Database_Project.sql`](https://github.com/NJSDragonBoltData/Nate_Stewart_Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/HR_Database_Project.sql)

**Description:** This project is about finding performance results while tracking and analyzing key metrics in a Human Resources department.
